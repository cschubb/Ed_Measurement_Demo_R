# Item Analysis
We are interested in looking at item.stat, which will look at basic item statistics. 

```{r, item-analysis}
# create key for dichotomous items
key = c("1","1", "1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1")


#Create an object for the model 
item.analysis <- itemanalysis1(data=child_data, key= key, options = c("A", "B"), correction = TRUE,
span.par=.3, verbose = T)

# Difficulty on first column
item.analysis$item.stat
  
```
